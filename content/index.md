ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Hal, a software engineer living in Brooklyn and building apps for iOS.

Currently Iâ€™m an iOS engineer at [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/). Previously, I led development of [Quartzâ€™s relaunched news app](https://qz.com/1724663/putting-members-at-the-heart-of-quartz/), and before that, I worked on Quartzâ€™s [conversational news app](https://qz.com/613700/its-here-quartzs-first-news-app-for-iphone/).

Hereâ€™re some projects Iâ€™ve worked on recently.
