Currently I work at [Quartz](https://qz.com), where I lead development of our recently launched, all-new, [member-focused news app](https://qz.com/1724663/putting-members-at-the-heart-of-quartz/). <br />Previously I worked on Quartzâ€™s [conversational news app](https://qz.com/613700/its-here-quartzs-first-news-app-for-iphone/).
