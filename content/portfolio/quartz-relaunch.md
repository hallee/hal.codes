# Quartz Relaunch

I led the development of a ground-up rewrite of the [Quartz iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quartz/id1437569339) in Swift.

[The relaunch](https://qz.com/1724663/putting-members-at-the-heart-of-quartz/) of the Quartz app put a new focus on our members and member exclusive content. The centerpiece of the app was a new “Home” feed, curated by Quartz editors, that featured our original reporting along with contributions from our reporters, members, and contributors.
