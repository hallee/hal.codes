# Quartz Objects

Objects was a project to bring augmented reality to news stories in the Quartz app.

The Quartz app was already a bit of a playground for experimentation — with a conversational interface and news stories accompanied by quirky animated gifs — so it was the perfect place to experiment with ARKit.

Ultimately we launched an AR journalism series called [The 2050 Project](https://qz.com/se/the-2050-project/) that used the Quartz app to showcase innovative buildings from cities around the globe.
