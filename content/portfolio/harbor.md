# Harbor: modern feed reader

With [Harbor](https://harbor.page), I built the RSS reader I always wanted: one with a beautiful interface, smart unified timeline, and no reliance on any third-party services for fetching or syncing feeds. I wanted a feed reader that I could browse casually like I do my Twitter timeline, with the ability to aggregate from hundreds of sources without feeling too overwhelming.

Harbor keeps its unified timeline manageable with a unique feed rating system. When you subscribe to a feed, you can tell Harbor you’re a “casual reader” or a “completionist” for that feed. Harbor then tries to ensure that you won’t miss a post from that blog you love that only posts once a month, while still allowing you to subscribe to feeds that post dozens of times per day.
