## Fore Rewrite

Fore 2 is a ground-up rewrite of one of my personally published apps.

[Fore](http://fore.photos) is a smart portait editor that uses algorithms to blur the background of portrait photos. I've always loved photos with [shallow depth of field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh), but achieving this naturally requires big, heavy cameras & lenses. The first version of the app was an attempt to bring lens blur to iPhone photos. I started work on it before Apple announced Portrait Mode, so it didn't use depth data from dual camera phones.

Version 2.0 fully embraces depth data, and keeps support for photos without it. Photos with no depth data are run through a custom [deep neural network](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/semantic-segmentation-basics.html) that automatically finds the background of the photo.
