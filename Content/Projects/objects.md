## Quartz Objects

Objects was a project to bring 3D objects to news stories in the Quartz app.

The Quartz app was a bit of a playground for experimentation already — it has a conversational interface, and news stories are accompanied by quirky animated gifs — so it was the perfect place to experiment with ARKit.

All of the objects were rendered with physically based textures using the native SceneKit renderer.
