## Quartz Objects

Objects is a project to bring 3D objects to news stories in the Quartz app.

The Quartz app was already a bit of a playground for experimentation — with a conversational interface and news stories accompanied by quirky animated gifs — so it was the perfect place to experiment with ARKit.

All of the objects are rendered with physically based textures using the native SceneKit renderer. A new screen showcases objects that have appeared in the news script with a custom `UICollectionView` layout and animated video previews.
